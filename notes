- queued to stack
  - delete migrations and rebuild
- property/field for turns
  - deck and target deck
- maybe new model for Turns
  - Turn vs SimpleAction, SpecificAction, QueueedAction......
- all action cards need queued turn for reactions???
- deck.top_deck bad
  - can shuffle but doesn't save. can be inconsistent
